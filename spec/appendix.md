## Appendices

### Appendix A: How this specification is produced

The Requests Answered, Construction Records, Proving Systems and derived Privacy Considerations sections, and every glossary term whose source file is prefixed `g-`, are generated from the machine-readable records in this repository's `conformance/` directory: `records/*.json` (construction records), `requests/*.json` (requests in the requester's own form), `stacks/*.json` (proving-system entries). The portable generator runs here with `node conformance/generate.mjs` (Apache-2.0), and its output is reviewed with its source records; the digest of the records it was generated from is stamped at the head of the generated text and re-checked by `conformance/test.mjs` on every change. To change a construction, change its record; a record that fails `conformance/validate.mjs` does not render.

The Introduction, Trust-Graph Operations, Public Inputs, Integration, Research and Book, Security, Governance, Internationalization and Accessibility Considerations, Conformance, References and these appendices are written by the editors. External evidence-repository imports require review so they do not overwrite local changes.

The explanatory Implementation Guide, Trust-Graph Operations, Research and Book, and Cryptographic Background chapters are maintained in the companion [DTG ZKP Implementation Guide](https://github.com/trustoverip/dtgwg-zkp-tf/tree/main/guide). The guide preserves the attribution and CC BY 4.0 grant for the adapted Cryptographic Background. Its source map pins the pre-extraction specification revision. Subsequent guide edits are reviewed in the task-force repository, not regenerated from the evidence archive.

Render locally with Spec-Up-T: `npm install && npm run render`; output in `docs/`, which this repository never commits.

### Appendix B: Relationship to the evidence repository

The task force keeps reference runtimes, conformance fixtures, a verification registry of independent reproductions and the working board from which construction records are promoted in a separate public repository, [DTG-ZKP-EVIDENCE]. That repository is deliberately not part of this specification: a specification should never depend on one laboratory, and a laboratory should never be mistaken for a specification. What crosses the boundary is data — records, fixtures, registry row identifiers — and the rule that nothing in this document claims more than that data shows.

**Local export draft.** This export includes uncommitted changes, or its cleanliness could not be checked. The commit below is the checkout base, not a reproducible pin for this draft. Commit the reviewed evidence changes and re-export before publication.

**Provenance of this revision.** The generated sections carry the SHA-256 of the records they were generated from (the stamp at the head of `spec/body.md`), and this revision was exported from [DTG-ZKP-EVIDENCE] at commit `7fc45aabc0c1f4dd3371d941107ada2d685b2491`, tag `untagged`, under which the same records, the fixtures and the registry rows they cite can be read. The evidence repository is hosted under a contributor's account and is licensed Apache-2.0 for code and CC BY 4.0 for documents, matching the task force's IPR posture; the conformance code shipped in this repository carries SPDX Apache-2.0 headers. Reproduction of the generated text needs only this repository; reproduction of a runtime needs the evidence repository at the pinned commit.

> **WG-12 — Discuss: home and pinning of the evidence repository.** The runtimes, fixtures and verification registry this draft cites live in a contributor-hosted repository. Decide whether to mirror or transfer it under the trustoverip organisation before this draft advances beyond Working Draft, and whether each Working Draft pins a tagged evidence revision rather than a commit. Status: proposed; no group decision recorded.

### Appendix C: Acknowledgements

The constructions in this specification rest on discussions in the DTG ZKP Task Force, the DTG Credentials Task Force and the DTG Credentials Core Specification repository. The editors thank Scott Jones for the working board and the work items placed on the record; Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay for the pressure tests that became negative-space clauses and for the requirements document's v0.4 draft; Glenn Gore for ADR-001 and the delegation design note; Geoff Turk and Drummond Reed for the correlation-scope resolution and the Working Draft 02 merge plan; Brendan Miller and Alberto Leon for the privacy-seam postulate and the implementation feedback that shaped the edge-verifiability definition; Denys Popov for the construction-detail work; and the authors of [PoP-2026] for the vouchable-credential model that construction 010 leans on.

### Appendix D: Changelog

- **Review revision (2026-09-21)** — the credential maintainer's review of the working draft (16 September) folded: record 007 states the task force's preference for where the ZK-openable commitment lives (DID-document verification method) and conditions the co-control MUST on a key profile; the WD02 example set is found unable to satisfy record 007 as it stands (an Ed25519 `did:key` cannot carry the commitment) — WG-14, with the *Identifier commitment profile* section in Integration; new primitive record **022** (blinded digest references) gives cred-spec #38 a record, with 008 re-read against cred-spec PR #56 and the `taskContext` change filed against the credential specification as its own issue — WG-15; the Introduction's credential catalogue corrected to the seven types; [DTG-CRED] pinned to a minimum compatible Document Status (0.4.0) and this draft's own Document Status made semantic (Working Draft 0.1.0); the credential specification cited by section title throughout the records, with its glossary cross-referenced as `DTG_CRED`; Conformance target 5 says which specification profiles the issuer-side requirement. Later the same day, the chair's Round 1 position folded: new composed record **023** (the two-vouch admission proof — an applicant proves k ≥ 2 vouches from distinct current members to the issuing community; Berkeley's reference code named as constructor, unmeasured); records gain an optional `reviews` part for recorded reviewer sign-off; the Introduction carries the field-name ↔ rendered-name mapping; Appendix E gains a Round 1 positions table; Appendix B pins a tagged evidence revision (`wd-0.1.0`) beside the commit. Evidence states unchanged; nothing adopted.

- **Vocabulary revision (2026-09-16)** — the machine-readable records and the sections generated from them use this specification's own terms throughout, in the JSON as well as the prose: `statement`, `witness`, `publicInputs`, `relation`, `disclosureSet`, `fixtures`, `options` (each with its `construction`), and a request's `record`; the record state `carded` is renamed `specified`; validator refusals are `record-*` for construction records and `request-*` for requests; the schema is `dtg-zkp/construction-record/v1`. In-document links to constructions and proving systems now resolve to the rendered heading ids. Provenance tightened: SPDX headers on the conformance code, [DTG-CRED] read at a named commit, the evidence-repository commit named in Appendix B (WG-12), and the editors' direction for the Cryptographic Background recorded (WG-13). No construction, claim, state or evidence changed.

- **Local review revision (2026-09-11)** — records 007 and 020 revised against the credential specification's merged VDC and VAC text and the common-control thread of 2026-09-10 (subject-or-issuer; chain predicates named as hidden-value equality); new primitive record 009 (hidden-value equality) and composed record 021 (VAC attenuation chain); the `hidden-equality` gadget; record 010 gains the blind-signature vouch option from the 8 September call; Security Considerations 5 widened; Internationalization hedged to WG-06a; conformance vector count corrected to the manifest; references pinned and completed; Appendix E review-notes index. Evidence states unchanged; nothing adopted.

- **Research additions (2026-09-10)** — Lattice Jolt / Akita recorded as a research option and Longfellow's stewardship under the Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance recorded, both under the V07 worklist; no adoption or state promotion.

- **Draft pull request opened (2026-09-08)** — trustoverip/dtgwg-zkp-spec PR #8 (branch `zk-book`, one commit); review requested in rounds on dtgwg-zkp-tf discussion #23.

- **Local review revision (2026-09-08)** — operational trust-graph reading path; presentation/integration design boundaries; continuous research and book process; narrowed transcript, membership, privacy, delegation and benchmark claims. Background moved after operational content. Existing evidence states retained; no new proof implementation, paper equivalence or normative adoption asserted.

- **0.1 (2026-09-05)** — first Working Draft scaffold: twelve construction records (eight primitive, four composed) at states `carded` and `constructed`; one request (ADR-001) with crosswalk; cryptographic background; public-input conventions; four proving-system entries; considerations; conformance targets and tests; the `conformance/` validation apparatus with continuous integration.

### Appendix E: Review-notes index

The numbered working-group notes are the decision points this draft asks reviewers to take up in Round 1 (shape) and Round 2 (record by record). The kinds are those of the Implementation Guide: *proposed for ratification*, *discuss*, *evidence request*. None records a decision; when one is resolved, the row gains the decision date, authority and source, and the note in the text is amended.

| note | kind | chapter | question | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WG-01 | proposed for ratification | Implementation Guide | credential-bound private membership eligibility as the first milestone; 010 as the flagship | proposed; no decision recorded |
| WG-02 | discuss | Implementation Guide | the first profile's issuance and witness contract (credential format, issuer route, holder key, offline linkage artifact) | unresolved |
| WG-03 | evidence request | Implementation Guide | a common workload and target device for comparing compatible routes | no backend recommendation adopted |
| WG-04 | proposed for ratification | Implementation Guide | proof verification, policy acceptance and action completion kept distinct | proposed wording |
| WG-05 | discuss | Public Inputs (set roots) | the registry contract: authority, leaf format, root construction, witness updates, staleness | unresolved |
| WG-06 | evidence request | Public Inputs (public-signal order) | a versioned, fixed-arity wire manifest checked against the compiled circuit | the sketch is not a wire format |
| WG-06a | proposed encoding decision | Public Inputs (transcript digest) | the lab's domain-separated hash as a named baseline; external digest representation; strict payload schema | draft proposal |
| WG-07 | discuss | Integration | task and implementation binding: pin Trust Tasks and OpenVTC revisions, select schemas | integration target |
| WG-08 | evidence and reviewer request | Research and Book | the paper-to-DTG mapping, an explanatory chapter, a reproducible worked construction | review requested |
| WG-09 | proposed for discussion | Appendices (maintenance note) | the survey-and-research maintenance method | optional editorial proposal |
| WG-10 | proposed for ratification | Introduction | general DTG scope, personhood and liveness as one use-case family | proposed; no decision recorded |
| WG-11 | proposed for discussion | Appendices (verification worklist) | the verification priorities V01–V12 | proposed queue |
| WG-12 | discuss | Appendices (evidence repository) | home and pinning of the evidence repository; licence coverage of the runtimes it hosts | proposed; no decision recorded |
| WG-14 | proposed for ratification | Integration (identifier commitment profile) | the ZK-openable commitment lives in the DID document as a verification method; the co-control requirement is a MUST conditioned on the key profile; the first implementation finds out which example DID method can carry it | proposed 2026-09-21; no decision recorded |
| WG-15 | discuss | Privacy Considerations (record 022) | blinded digest references: which digest-valued members carry a salt and where it lives is the credential specification's disposition (cred-spec #38); this draft states what the proof needs of each placement | record specified; disposition open on #38 |
| WG-16 | discuss | Construction records (023, 024) | which statement the Linux Plumbers admission proof establishes — 023 (k vouches over member-issued relationship credentials), 024 (hidden vetting), or both as alternative admission modes | proposed 2026-09-23; no decision recorded |
| WG-13 | direction | Cryptographic Background | move the chapter to the companion implementation guide; retain a pointer in the specification | editorial extraction prepared following the 22 September discussion; publication pending |

### Round 1 positions

Position records filed in Round 1 (shape), in the form the evidence repository's `PATH-MAP.md` asks for — ratify · refine · refute · build — and the editors' disposition of each. A position is a member's reading, not a group decision.

| member | date | ratify | refine | refute | build | scope | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| chair (ScottJeezey) | 2026-09-21 | the construction-record structure, the CI-enforced drafting rules, the state ladder | (1) a field-name ↔ rendered-name mapping; (2) Cryptographic Background to the companion guide; (3) a numbering note for the 013→020 gap; (4) tighter provenance and Apache-2.0 coverage given the evidence-repo dependence | — | a record for the two-vouch admission proof (a non-member proves two vouches from distinct members to the issuer), Berkeley's reference code as constructor | 007's key-profile condition, 009 and 022 need the cryptographers' sign-off (Denys, Berkeley) recorded before hardening | (1) the mapping is in the Introduction and `conformance/README.md`; (2) WG-13: with the core/guide split after Round 1; (3) the index states the ranges; (4) Appendix B pins a tagged evidence revision; build → record 023 at `specified`, constructor named; scope → records carry a `reviews` part for recorded sign-off |

### Guide maintenance and verification worklist

The explanatory maintenance method and V01–V12 worklist are now in the [companion guide](https://trustoverip.github.io/dtgwg-zkp-tf/).

> **WG-09 — Proposed for discussion: maintenance method.** Does the group want this survey-and-research process for preparing reviewable updates? Confirm source scope and decision-record practice. Status: optional editorial proposal, not a protocol requirement.

> **WG-11 — Proposed for discussion: verification priorities.** Review the use-case fit, dependencies and acceptance evidence below. Confirm the first full-statement comparison and identify independent reproduction support. Status: proposed queue; no assignments or results implied.

- **Hidden-vetting revision (2026-09-23)** — record 024 adds the local Groth16 route with explicit uncovered clauses; WG-16 remains open. Lean metadata covers ten primitives; no task-force adoption or complete formal conformance is implied.
